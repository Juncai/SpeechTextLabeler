Uh, shall we start[E]?
We were started[E] in the 1950, our founder[E] Alfonse Perrigreen began with two[E] questions.
What makes a stock[E] become a great[E] stock? What[E] must be in place before I buy[E]?
To find[E] the answers[E], he began studying great stocks[E] of the past[E], looking for common characteristics. He found[E] seven[E] factors that occurred repeatedly[E], year after year, decade after decade.
He used that discovery[E] to develop[E] an investing[E] discipline, based not on hunches[E], but[E] on historical fact[E].
Alfonse[E] Perrigreen[E] used their approach to achieve[E] remarkable[E] success in the market[E].
By the time he turned forty[E], he had purchased a seat on the New York Stock Exchange[E] and had founded[E] Perrigreen and Foley Associates that now serves[E] over[E] six[E] hundred and fifty[E] of the worldâ€™s[E] largest mutual funds[E] and institutional investors. And anyone can use it successfully.
