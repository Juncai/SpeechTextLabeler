What makes a stock[e] become a great[e] stock What[e] must be in place before I buy[e] 
To find[e] the answers[e] he began studying great stocks[e] of the past[e] looking for common characteristics He found[e] seven[e] factors that occurred repeatedly[e] year after year decade after decade 
He used that discovery[e] to develop[e] an investing[e] discipline based not on hunches[e] but[e] on historical fact[e] 
Alfonse[e] Perrigreen[e] used their approach to achieve[e] remarkable[e] success in the market[e]
